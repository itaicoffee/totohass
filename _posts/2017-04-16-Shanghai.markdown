Rainy, frothy spring air. Pearson International, a dizzying air hub, Canada's largest. We exchange two plastic banknotes for a Morning Street rice bowl, egg sandwich and a flat, watery beer. A super-sized vessel with a proud snout is parked outside the gate, whose tall ceilings, broad mouth and yarn string of antsy passengers marks our departure from North America.

Fifteen hours stretch like 90's bubble gum into a lifetime of stiff necks, dumpling babies, and a friendly bio-chem PhD plopped in a seat to our left. Her home town is an authority on some Chinese food, or so she alleges as she deftly prods her monitor in attempt of solving a Sudoku.

We talk blandification, Reddit, and The Matrix, then binge on Atlanta, a comedy series starring Childish in Gucci Mane-esque shenanigans. Hunger ensues.

Sir, can I interest you in some: Corn and carrot swim in a hot slurpy burpy derpy noodley noodle soup that vanishes moments after presentation. Two wrinkled crackers suffocate inside plastic wrappers as we bite into an attractive brownie that tastes like legos. Double Heineken and a mini shampoo bottle of wine. Finally, like an infinite sequence kissing its asymptote, the plane lands. Shanghai, China.

Cash, taxi, city, bikes, honks, haze, warmth, movement, eats. Calm mania and new history on the Bund. Buried under a mountain of crab dumplings, we fall asleep.
